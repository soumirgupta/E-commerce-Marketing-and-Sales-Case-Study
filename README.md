# 🗂️ Dataset
The project utilizes multiple datasets containing information about customer purchases, customer details, marketing spends, offers used and tax details.
- Customers.csv
- Discount_Coupon.csv
- Marketing_Spend.csv
- Online_Sales.csv
- Tax_amount.csv

# 📊 The study is guided by specific research questions, and the analysis is systematically carried out to answer each question using statistical and visual evidence. 📈
- Identify the months with the highest and lowest customer acquisition count. What strategies could be implemented to address the fluctuations and ensure consistent growth throughout the year?
- Analyze the data to determine if certain months consistently show higher or lower acquisition. How can the company capitalize on high-performing months and improve performance during slower periods? 
- Identify periods with the strongest and weakest retention rates. What strategies could be implemented to improve retention during weaker months?
- Analyze customer behavior during high-retention months and suggest ways to replicate this success throughout the year.
- Compare the revenue generated by new and existing customers month-over-month. What does this trend suggest about the balance between acquisition and retention efforts?
- Analyze the relationship between coupon usage and revenue generation. How can discount strategies be optimized to maximize revenue while maintaining profitability?
- Identify the top-performing products and analyze the factors driving their success. How can this insight inform inventory management and promotional strategies?
- Analyze the relationship between monthly marketing spend and revenue. Are there any months where marketing efforts yielded disproportionately high or low returns? How can marketing strategies be adjusted to improve ROI?
- Evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns by comparing marketing spend to revenue generated. Are there opportunities to reallocate resources for better results?
- Segment customers into groups such as Premium, Gold, Silver, and Standard. What targeted strategies can be developed for each segment to improve retention and revenue? (Use RFM segmentation techniques)
- Analyze the revenue contribution of each customer segment. How can the company focus its efforts on high-value segments while nurturing lower-value segments?
- Group customers by their month of first purchase and analyze retention rates over time. Which cohorts exhibit the highest and lowest retention rates? What strategies can be implemented to improve retention for weaker cohorts?
- Analyze the lifetime value of customers acquired in different months. How can this insight inform acquisition and retention strategies?
- Identify seasonal trends in sales by category and location. How can the company prepare for peak and off-peak seasons to maximize revenue?
- Analyze daily sales trends to identify high-performing and low-performing days. What strategies can be implemented to boost sales on slower days?
